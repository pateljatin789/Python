'''If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’
again. Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?'''

a = 10
print(a)
b = 20
print(b)

#again assigned (a)
a = 30
print(a)
# in the python we can reassigned to a new value, variable like a empty container we can put any data type and replace with any data type.
